# Intermittent Error in Next.js 15 App with API Route

This repository demonstrates an uncommon error in a Next.js 15 application that involves an API route. The error is intermittent and difficult to debug, as it doesn't produce clear error messages.

## Description

A Next.js 15 app fetches data from an API route ('/api/hello') on the '/about' page. Under normal circumstances, this works fine.  However, sometimes when navigating to '/about' the page will not load.  There are no clear error messages, it just hangs or shows a blank screen.  The issue is not easily reproduced or isolated. The problem may relate to edge caching, or timing between rendering and fetching. 

## Reproduction Steps

1. Clone the repository.
2. Run `npm install`.
3. Run `npm run dev`.
4. Navigate to `/about` page repeatedly. You may need to try this multiple times to trigger the error. 

## Solution

The solution involves adding a simple check for the response status before proceeding with JSON parsing. This helps handle potential network errors gracefully.
